# Contributing

This document explains how, technically, to contribute to this project. A code of conduct may be available in the root of this repository, or included in the READEME.md file.

## Contribution Workflow

* On GitHub, check the issues and draft pull requests to see if anyone is working on something similar.
* Create a new issue or comment on an existing one, asking to be assigned.
* Make a fork of this repository.
* [Optionally] make a branch for your contribution.
* Implement your feature, bug fix, documentation, etc.
* Make a pull request against the `main` branch of this repository.

You are advised to make a draft pull request as soon as you start work so nobody else ends up working on the same thing.

## Coding Style

* Please format your code using `black`

## Documentation

* Documentation is required at approximately the same dilution
as the existing code.
Please avoid adding lots of types to the documentation
like Sphinx encourages.

## [Typehints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)

* Do not use typehints.

## Tests

* Tests are encouraged; please use [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).

## Static Analysis

* Would be interested to hear reports of using [`pylint`](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) or similar.
